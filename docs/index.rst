`h-emcee` Documentation
=======================

:code:`h-emcee` is an implementation of ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance,
based on `Y. Chen (2025) <ychen25_url>`_ and implemented in :code:`JAX`.
We also include affine-invariant schemes for tuning hyperparameters of HMC samplers (e.g., step size, number of leapfrog steps).

The philosophy and syntax of this package are meant as a minimal replacement for `emcee <emcee_url>`_.
This is a pure-Python implementation designed for easy statistical inference (no graphical models needed).

Basic Example
---------------
All you need is access to the unnormalized log probability!

.. code-block:: python
   
   import jax
   import jax.numpy as jnp
   import hemcee

   def log_prob(x):
      return -0.5 * jnp.sum(x ** 2)

   num_walkers, dim = 100, 5
   key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
   inital_states = jax.random.normal(key, shape=(num_walkers, dim))

   sampler = hemcee.HamiltonianEnsembleSampler(num_walkers, dim, log_prob)
   sampler.run_mcmc(inital_states, 10000)

For a more through example, see :doc:`tutorials/quickstart`.
